		Websites wouldn't be very interesting if you couldn't get from one to another. This
		network of connections is why we call it 'the web'.

		A link is created with in several parts:
		+ the 'anchor' tag or <a>
		+ the URL within the anchor tag with the attribute 'href'
		+ the link's text that the user sees

		For example:
			<a href='http://www.amazon.com'>Amazon</a>

		Anything can be a link! Text, images, sections of the page...

		<p>A basic link sends to you to another page; the code is 'inline', or within the line of text.  The anatomy of a link:</p>
			
		<!-- 	note, we have to use special characters for the < and > so they
			 	don't make a real link! see '04_TextFormatting.html' for more info -->
		<p><code>  &lt;a href="anotherPage.html"&gt;the text that will be a link&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>

		<!--	link to another page in the same folder -->
		<p>Links to <a href="01-first-page-ever.html">internal pages</a>, in the same folder, can be listed as simply the filename.</p>

		<!--	link to a page (or other item) in a subfolder -->
		<p>To link into a <a href="example-of-a-subfolder/catguitar.gif">subfolder</a> (perhaps of images), use the <code>nameOfFolder/nameOfFile.extension</code></p>

		<!--	link to a page on another site -->
		<p>Links to <a href="http://www.kask.be">external pages</a> (on another site) should always include the full URL including the <code>http://</code> part.</p>
